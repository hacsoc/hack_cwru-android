HackCWRU Android
===================
Hello World! Welcome to CWRU's recently inspired ambition to make the best hackathon app ever.  This is the android version. That's right, iOS fanboys and fangirls move out! Here are some links to the other repositories:

[iOS](https://github.com/hacsoc/hack_cwru-ios)

[Backend](https://github.com/hacsoc/hack_cwru)

We'll primarily be using Trello to track feature assignment and progress. If you aren't in HacSoc or haven't been added to the board, contact <adam@case.edu>. Major bugs are to be reported in issues up and to the right, while free beer and food is to be sent again to <adam@case.edu>.

# Version History
0.0.0
- Its gonna be a blast

# Running this bad boy
I wouldn't for a while.... but if you want to, download/git clone me, get Android studio, run android run!

# Development
Do you know how to Android?  Or would you like to learn how and in the process make a sweet app?  Then let's Android together.  

If you don't know what youre doing, git clone this wittle repo into any diretory you want, preferable empty.

If you don't have gradle install, run the gradlew script.  Once thats done, just  run gradle and wait.  Basically it makes like a dog and fetches all of the dependencies so you don't mess it up.  It can also setup a workspace for you.

Hold on now, we don't want you just committing willie nillie so before you get started we ask you to contact us.  I can be reached at <acv31@case.edu> (to my dismay, anno@case.edu is taken).  If by this point you arent a java fanatic and want to help with something else, you can head over to the other repos or contact <adam@case.edu> for iOS and <mason@case.edu> for backend (raillssss).

We're using the following protocol with forking and pushing:

If you're an owner

    Work on a topic branch
    Merge in the master branch
    Push your topic branch
    Wait for a +1 from another owner (and any CI hooks) before merging

Slightly different if youâ€™re not an owner (but we still accept contributions from anyone!)

    Fork the repo
    Work on a topic branch
    Merge in the upstream master branch
    Push your topic branch
    Wait for a +1 from an owner (and any CI hooks) before merging

# How to Android?
Well I have no clue, but its Java, so how hard can it be?
